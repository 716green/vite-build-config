# DON'T TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY

This was created to test some of the features with Vite's React build tool.

This was created as a joke and was never intended to be seen by anybody. If you're seeing this, don't bother. There is nothing interesting here.

It took a bit of debugging to get it to work correctly. This is only being pushed to my GitHub for future reference, or until I document the build process in Notion.
